2019 Austin Hackathon HackTx contestant repository that contains a single page website that is able to predict possible delays in flights using American Airline's flights and the dark sky API. 24 hour hackathon. 2019 American Airlines 1st place winner. (Updated December 24, 2019)
## Description of Website
Our website UI was created by our team using html, CSS, and Javascript. The website pulls from American Airlines API and the Dark Sky API using HTTP GET. The infortamation obtained is weather behavior during time and location of plane while it is on flight. Using the information, we perform analysis and implement an algorithm that predicts likelihood of delay. We hope people could use this information in order to predict whether their flight is likely to delay ahead of time.
